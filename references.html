                                            This website is an essential for jamband fans and listeners of live recordings. It has a forum where oldheads talk about their tour stories, 
                                            but its primary function is as a hub for thousands upon thousands of live music downloads (via torrent). The site is quite dated and signing up requires
                                            emailing an admin, but I know of no other archive with as many rare tapes.

                                            I don't see as much live music as I'd like, but Jambase is an invaluable tool for identifying the acts coming to your area. 
                                            Go to the 'Concerts' and you'll see what I'm what I'm talking about. From pubs to arenas, it lists all of the shows happening soon in your area.
                                            I'm suprised a bigger corporation hasn't created an intuitive tool to fulfill the same purpose, but until then, there's Jambase.
