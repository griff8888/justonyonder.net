                                        This coming semester I will be studying abroad in Cairo, Egypt. Like most things in my life, I have yet to process this rapidly approaching excursion. I’m an American who has never left the country – this will be an experience to say the least. What’s most frightening is that I have yet to feel any sort of anxiety for what’s to come, which has a couple possible outcomes. I could either breakdown when I get there, or I have no problem transitioning at all. Reality will likely fall somewhere in the middle.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The country is beyond majority Muslim, around 90% if I remember correctly. As an American, I’m certain somewhere in my belief system is some Islamophobia. My intention is to be as welcoming to the culture that I’ll shortly be surrounded by as I hope they are to me. Within my previous understanding, I was not aware of how conservatively everyone dresses, even the men. Oh no! Boohoo! Griffin will have to endure the Egyptian heat in pants – how awful! Don’t worry, I’ve acquired some ultra breathable joggers that will be both stylish and cool.

                                        I expect my culture shock to be rooted in the sheer amount of difference from my perceived normal as well as the forced analysis of my everyday privileges. I wonder to what extent I am exaggerating the contrast I will notice, because at the end of the day people are people. Last March I visited New York City. It was my first time on the East Coast. My interpretation of the city was completely drawn up by movies and the time I’d spent watching Casey Neistat’s vlogs. I thought that I was going to be at a loss of words, and I was wrong. It was just like any other place I’d ever been. Yes, there’s a subway and an abundance of good Italian food, but like anywhere else, New York City is filled with people living their lives.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        This is what I’m thinking about as my departure date approaches. Undoubtedly, Griffin the foreigner will make a fool of himself on more than a handful of occasions. It will be an extreme test of my active listening skills. I look forward to eating good food and meeting good people. I’m unaware of how strange this might sound to others, but I most look forward to people watching. People watching effectively requires that one not be bogged down by their assumptions and their immediate observation – boy am I bad at that.

                                        I am really quite terrible at interacting with difference. I’ve only recently identified this about myself. I tend to approach differences in opinion with passive aggression. To counteract it, it’s essential that I catch myself and take a moment to breathe. Two people’s ideas will commonly be entirely isolated from one another but rarely do they directly clash. Most opinions can peacefully co-exist and on other occasions open dialogue usually does the trick.

                                        My trip to Egypt will challenge me to be more understanding than I ever have been. I can say that I’m ready, but I’m not. Cheers to difference and the memories that I’ll reflect on for a lifetime.

                                        I’m not in the place to even process such a passing. Several hours ago my mom came to me in the kitchen and said, “Griffin, I have some awful news. Bob Weir died.” If not already obvious, blog posts to come will reveal how the integral the Grateful Dead have been in my life thus far. Fans often refer to these legends as if they are their close friends, and as cringey as that can sometimes be, I cannot deter myself.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Bobby, you lived by the virtues that you sang. You did your song and dance not for the audience but for yourself. Without exaggerating, I can state that your music has been the soundtrack to my life. You are one of the most Rock n’ Roll motherfuckers to ever grace the Earth. You lived the rockstar lifestyle but never caved to it. In your old years you became a health icon, enforcing the notion that art is only as powerful as the artist’s mental and physical fortitude. You were flashy within your own definition. With your short shorts and exaggerated throwing of your arms when you strummed, your confidence always incited courage into those willing to listen. 
                                    </p>

                                        I have no doubts that you are in a better place and am thankful that in your time here you blessed thousands of recordings with your presence. Weir’s musicianship is certainly the most underappreciated of those in the Dead. The man had a godlike understanding of the fretboard. The only way to truly note this is by listening to his isolated guitar parts. Gliding seamlessly between counterpoint and chorus, he was the secret sauce. I grieve his loss, but my God does it make me happy to think about the life he lived. The articles that have come out in the hours since his passing mention that he dropped out of high school to play with the Dead. He would play all night, go to school in the morning, and eventually he realized he got more out of one than the other.

                                        For those who are perhaps unfamiliar but still want to pay tribute, I insist that you “listen to the music play.” On “China Cat Sunflower” Jerry and Bobby’s guitar parts intertwine to produce the most happy-go-lucky melody you’ve ever heard. On the masterpiece “Weather Report Suite,” he wrote alongside John Perry Barlow, you illustrate the turning of the season and why all good must come to an end. Bob Weir spent 60 years performing these songs – a pursuit that he and the deadheads believed to be noble. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        In this bleak world, Bobby has brought me so much joy. And though I never met the man, its feels as if him and I have a shared a million laughs. He only wanted two things out of life: to play guitar and be a cowboy. He was damn good at the first and as for the second, my golly if he didn’t wear a damn convincing costume in his last few years – poncho and all. Bobby’s presence is no longer tangible, but it is here for those who need it. Thank you for your unlimited gifts, and I wish you smooth ride into the world to come.

                                        What the hell is it to you what I do with my time? Nah, just kidding. 
                                        I’m making a blog because I have things I want to say, regardless of whether people actually care about them. I also think the idea of starting a 
                                        blog in the year 2026 is hysterical – talk about an irrelevant medium. A characteristic of mine is that I love the irrelevant. 
                                        I’m always late to the party. More than that, I like old things. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Several years ago, I started collecting cassette tapes, eventually moving on to vinyl. I’m definitely a no good hipster. 
                                        Tangentially, I’m also gradually moving through music history, feeling as if when I listen to a new-to-me artist, their only now entering the collective 
                                        consciousness that is pop culture. I started with the music of the 60s and just recently I realized I’m in deep on the 90s 
                                        (The Melvins, Cowboy Junkies, PJ Harvey, etc. etc.). So, as blogs are a definite relic of the past, this is another way in which I can feel like I’m 
                                        progressing towards the modern era.

                                        Believe it or not, the start of this blog is also fulfilling a college graduation requirement. 
                                        My school has an extended January break in which students are to complete a project of their own design. 
                                        The creation of this website and beginning to fill it with content is the project I decided on. Riveting! As an English and Computer Science student it seemed like the perfect synergy.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        What I find to be coolest about programming is that an individual can create a platform of completely their own design. 
                                        The content and the medium by which it’s presented are entirely customizable. 
                                        In the moment that I write, this website is stupid simple. 
                                        I’ve not even finished the most basic of functionality and there are definitely some blemishes to cover up. 
                                        My intention is for this blog to eventually feel not like a ‘relic’ but rather a modern website that also happens to articulate who I am as an individual.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        My oh my – as you can already tell, I’m a rambler. 
                                        I’m making a blog because I’m a massive deadhead without any friends who’re interested in talking about the intricacies of 
                                        Phil’s influences or why Jerry’s guitar tone is absolutely perfect. I’m making a blog because I’ve played the guitar for nearly five years now and can’t 
                                        play anything all that impressive. I’m making a blog because I have no idea how to interpret my thoughts unless they exist in some tangible form such as this. 
                                        I’m making a blog because I like attention. So, dear reader, please do read and relish over every single word.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> 
                                        Thoughts are only as significant as the extent to which they exist outside of the individual’s brain. This in no way makes me unique, 
                                        but I have lots of thoughts. The majority of them are forgotten – left for the void – and never acted upon. 
                                        I have the sick twisted perception that I matter in the grand scheme of things and, as such, think that everyone of one my ideas should be evaluated. 
                                        How are these ideas to be evaluated if they are not further manifested? This is why I’m making a blog; to give validity to the only activity that I can 
                                        repeated return to without becoming upset with my lack of progression – thinking.

                                        My name’s Griffin. Around the time I started high school I began journalling. In my freshman English class we had to write a full page in our notebook 
                                        every Tuesday. These were called “Tuesday Reflection Papers.” I had trouble with the task, but I was always satisfied when I got to the bottom of a page. 
                                        Jumping to six months later, I’m on spring break, and I’ve just been informed that I won’t be going back to school because of Coronavirus.

                                        <br>
                                        During those months I was so bored. Repeatedly I found myself annoyed with the friends I played videogames with all day. 
                                        To document the interesting moment I was living through, and to perhaps process some of it, I began journalling. 
                                        Once or twice a week I convinced myself that I had something to write about and it always turned out I did.

                                        At the beginning of my senior year, it was time to begin applying to colleges. A definitive part of the application is the College Essay. 
                                        They require you to write about a time you’ve been challenged, what inspires you, or what your education means to you. 
                                        At the time, and up until the moment that I write this, I have never been truly challenged. God, the universe, the androgynous power above, 
                                        or perhaps just a series of chemical reactions have served me such a life that does not require a lot. I’m privileged to an extent that is hard to 
                                        fathom and for this life I am incredibly grateful.

                                        Sometime around the start of my second year in college, I filled up my original notebook. It was a purple college ruled spiral notebook – 
                                        I think you can get them for a dollar at Walmart. To some people 70 pages front and back doesn’t seem like a lot, and frankly it’s not, 
                                        but to me it was everything. I felt so proud, prouder than I’ve ever felt about anything. I still journal but with varied consistency. 
                                        I didn’t journal once over summer, but three weeks ago I did every day for a week. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I, then, had great difficulty deciding what I would write about for my essay. Well, what do you know it, at this point I’d spent a decent amount of 
                                        time journalling. So, that was my topic. If I had to write that same essay today, I think it would come out nearly identical. I wrote about how 
                                        journalling, for me, is a release of the subconscious narration that goes on at all waking moments. Of course, many of the ideas I am aware of. 
                                        However, what I’ve found is that I get to the bottom of a page and what sits in front of me is a line of reason completely beyond myself.

                                        It has been an infallible tool for my self-development in all directions. This is the context for what you’re reading presently. I’ve always thought a 
                                        blog sounded fun, so here I am. Most of my journal entries narrate how I could’ve handled a situation better, and that may make its way on here, 
                                        but for the most part the subjects of discussion will reflect my personal interests: music, guitar, mental health, well-being, traveling (hopefully), 
                                        or whatever else I’m actively infatuated with.

                                        So, if any of that interests you, stick around. If not, but you read this far anyway, thanks anyways – I’ll see you in a future life.
