                <h3>Welcome!</h3>        
                    <p>If you are reading this, then you somehow stumbled upon my own personal abomination. 
                        I think everyone should have one. I for one have thoughts that have no reason 
                        being anywhere but the void. Despite their nullity, I've put them here on this website.</p>
                <h3>Who is the man behind the curtain?</h3>
                    <p>Who? Me? You're talking to me? Name's Griffin and that's all you'll get out of me.
                        I like to think I'm a person of eclectic taste -- oh, but aren't we all?</p>
                    <p>Yes, everyone has interests. I'm not as special as I like to think I am. The first fact I'll throw
                        out is that I'm a big deadhead. Though I have my gripes with some genres, I'm a lover of music in general.</p>
                    <p>Since the inception of movies, filmmakers have adapted literature into films. It makes
                        sense; there is no shortage of great literature. And since the beginning of this phenomenon, the
                        same qualm has been raised repeatedly: the movie does not do the book justice. No matter the
                        release, a group of people always stand by this argument. It certainly has nothing to do with the
                        source text – Harry Potter, Hunger Games, Lord of the Rings, these are texts beloved by many.
                        The relationship between film adaptations and their respective criticism will be explored through
                        a comparative analysis of Daphne Du Maurier’s 1971 short story “Don’t Look Now” and Nicolas
                        Roeg’s 1973 film of the same name. After considering Don’t Look Now’s success as an
                        adaptation as well as its success as a film independent of the short story, I will corroborate my
                        analysis with the argument that Robert Stam poses in his essay “Beyond Fidelity: The Dialogics
                        of Adaptation” to show that the conversations surrounding adaptations tend to be closed-minded.
                        At a glance, Maurier’s short story “Don’t Look Now” and Roeg’s film adaptation tell a
                        nearly identical story, and most of the time, the sequence of events overlaps perfectly. When the
                        adaptation diverges from the original story, the intention is to conform to the medium of film. As
                        a short story, the story is, in fact, short. So, several of the changes that appear in the adaptation
                        are done so that it reaches the length of a feature film. Rather than placing the audience in a
                        restaurant, the opening shows how John and Laura’s daughter Christine dies. While pulling this
                        scene out of thin air does add a few extra minutes, it also acts as a catalyst for the emotional
                        relationship between the viewer and the characters. The scene’s presence exacerbates sympathy
                        for two grieving parents that would have been challenging to attain otherwise. The adaptation
                        also takes the creative liberty of changing the couple’s vacation in Venice to a weeks-long work
                        trip. Distracted by the restoration of a chapel, John dismisses the death of his daughter and fails
                        to consider Laura’s state of mind. The scenes during construction give a concreteness and
                        physicality to John’s decided ignorance. In the adaptation, John’s emotional immaturity is
                        associated with a strong visual, but the source text uses explicit narration. Following their first
                        interaction with the twins, the narrator states, “It’s going to be all right, [John] decided, let her
                        believe what she likes, it doesn’t matter, it makes her happy” (Maurier 12). While these changes
                        extend the runtime, they are not fruitless in terms of what they provide the story. Roeg’s film
                        distorts Maurier’s text but does so in a way that maintains its meaning.
                        The successful conversion of a text from one medium to another does not guarantee that
                        it will maintain the same level of quality. That is to say that an adaptation accurately depicting
                        the ideas of its source text and an adaptation being objectively good, however that may be
                        defined, are adjacent achievements rather than corresponding ones. I believe Roeg’s Don’t Look
                        Now to be unequivocally average in comparison to the short story. It most closely identifies with
                        the thriller genre, but even that is a loose definition. Repeatedly, the film implies that action is
                        forthcoming, only to pique the viewer’s interest and fall short. The scene where John is listening
                        to the twin’s psychic trance from the other side of the door is one of these instances. The twin is
                        screaming bloody murder, grabbing the viewer by the collar. Once her vision passes, all the
                        generated tension is let go. Yes, the scene is essential to the following sequence, but the energy
                        murder does properly release tension, but as it comes at the end, the viewer is already
                        accustomed to the pattern of anticlimax. Another point of critique is that the film has aged like it
                        was released in 1973. I would not recommend this movie to a friend looking for something to
                        watch. Every time this film used the high-pitched shrill that has become a defining sound of the
                        thriller and horror genres, I wondered if it was a joke. The sex scene is another aspect that dates
                        it. As risqué as a scene of that vulgarity is for the time period, its inclusion suggests that the
                        director was trying to take a stance that is never fully elucidated. Even compared to movies of
                        the modern day, it provided a remarkable net zero to the story. Despite the respect and integrity
                        Roeg’s adaptation serves Maurier’s short story, the final product is nothing special.
                        Having valued the successfulness of Roeg’s Don’t Look Now both in terms of an
                        adaptation and a text within itself, it should now be considered what these conclusions
                        State about adaptations generally. To do so, I will look at the argument made by Robert Stam in
                        his essay “Beyond Fidelity: The Dialogics of Adaptation.” In analogizing film adaptation to
                        fidelity, he states that their reception is framed within the binary created by emotions. “Words
                        such as infidelity and betrayal in this sense translate our feeling, when we have loved a book,
                        that an adaptation has been worthy of that love” (Stam 54). Stam explains that critique founded
                        on one’s personal intimacy with a source text is not a factor by which adaptation should be
                        judged. He goes so far as to suggest that adaptation should not be valued by its defining feature:
                        difference in medium. “The cinema has not lesser, but rather greater resources for expression
                        than the novel, and this is independent of what actual filmmakers have done with these
                        resources” (59). Then, returning to the texts of Maurier and Roeg, the conclusion that the film is
                        a good adaptation but a bad movie appears intrinsic to adaptation as a tradition.
                        Countering the fidelity analogy, Stam states, “What tropes might be more appropriate?
                        One trope, I would suggest, is ‘translation’” (62). In viewing adaptation and translation as two
                        sides of a coin, one could construe that translation is an easier task. As both the original and
                        translated texts are in the written mode, they must have one-to-one correspondence. This could
                        not be further from the truth. Stam compares the product of translation to the interpretation that
                        any given individual reader will extract from a text. “The trope of adaptation as a ‘reading’ of the
                        source novel (…) suggests that just as any text can generate an infinity of readings, so that any
                        novel can generate any number of adaptations (63).” So, rather than falling under a binary of
                        good or bad, Roeg’s film exists in a spectrum that encompasses all the better or worse
                        adaptations that could have been. Moreover, since these are hypotheticals – that is to say, not
                        tangible – judging the film as a stand-alone text is more productive than evaluating it solely as an
                        adaptation.
                        So, if there is no value in qualitatively comparing the adaptation to its source text, then
                        what is the purpose of examining these texts’ relationship? Stam suggests the purpose is to
                        further ‘story’ the source text. He states that additions in adaptation “can have any number of
                        motivations: to take advantage of a brilliant actor, to suggest contemporary relevance, or to
                        ‘correct’ the novel for aesthetic reasons” (72). Whichever it may have been, the implication is
                        that Roeg identified Maurier’s short story as a work that deserved more recognition. And though
                        the results may vary, the intention of the filmmaker is never to make a bad adaptation. The goal
                        is to share the unique idea of a source text in a way that projects it into a new context.
                        As a case study of how criticism should interact with adaptations, Roeg’s interpretation
                        of Maurier’s “Don’t Look Now” demonstrates that accurately translating a story to a new
                        medium does not guarantee the same degree of quality. The mediums themselves have
                        characteristics that may not exist in some other medium. Personal biases will affect the extent to
                        which one sees an adaptation as good, and the truth is that opinions can differ and still all be
                        correct. Binary thinking ends the conversation while exploring the space that exists between
                        poles will yield constructive criticism at the least. If, by viewing a film adaptation as an entity
                        independent of its source text, you have a more productive interaction, then why not do so? </p>
