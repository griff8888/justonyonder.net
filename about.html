                                        My name’s Griffin. Around the time I started high school I began journalling. In my freshman English class we had to write a full page in our notebook 
                                        every Tuesday. These were called “Tuesday Reflection Papers.” I had trouble with the task, but I was always satisfied when I got to the bottom of a page. 
                                        Jumping to six months later, I’m on spring break, and I’ve just been informed that I won’t be going back to school because of Coronavirus.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        During those months I was so bored. Repeatedly I found myself annoyed with the friends I played videogames with all day. 
                                        To document the interesting moment I was living through, and to perhaps process some of it, I began journalling. 
                                        Once or twice a week I convinced myself that I had something to write about and it always turned out I did.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        At the beginning of my senior year, it was time to begin applying to colleges. A definitive part of the application is the College Essay. 
                                        They require you to write about a time you’ve been challenged, what inspires you, or what your education means to you. 
                                        At the time, and up until the moment that I write this, I have never been truly challenged. God, the universe, the androgynous power above, 
                                        or perhaps just a series of chemical reactions have served me such a life that does not require a lot. I’m privileged to an extent that is hard to 
                                        fathom and for this life I am incredibly grateful.                   
                                    </p>
                                </div> 
                                <div class="imgRight">

                                        Sometime around the start of my second year in college, I filled up my original notebook. It was a purple college ruled spiral notebook – 
                                        I think you can get them for a dollar at Walmart. To some people 70 pages front and back doesn’t seem like a lot, and frankly it’s not, 
                                        but to me it was everything. I felt so proud, prouder than I’ve ever felt about anything. I still journal but with varied consistency. 
                                        I didn’t journal once over summer, but three weeks ago I did every day for a week. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I, then, had great difficulty deciding what I would write about for my essay. Well, what do you know it, at this point I’d spent a decent amount of 
                                        time journalling. So, that was my topic. If I had to write that same essay today, I think it would come out nearly identical. I wrote about how 
                                        journalling, for me, is a release of the subconscious narration that goes on at all waking moments. Of course, many of the ideas I am aware of. 
                                        However, what I’ve found is that I get to the bottom of a page and what sits in front of me is a line of reason completely beyond myself.

                                        It has been an infallible tool for my self-development in all directions. This is the context for what you’re reading presently. I’ve always thought a 
                                        blog sounded fun, so here I am. Most of my journal entries narrate how I could’ve handled a situation better, and that may make its way on here, 
                                        but for the most part the subjects of discussion will reflect my personal interests: music, guitar, mental health, well-being, traveling (hopefully), 
                                        or whatever else I’m actively infatuated with.

                                        So, if any of that interests you, stick around. If not, but you read this far anyway, thanks anyways – I’ll see you in a future life.
