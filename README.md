                                This is an image image of Jerry Garcia's 'Tiger' guitar, custom built by legendary luthier Doug Irwin. 
                                I'm embarking on a guitar build of my own, very much inspired by the custom instrumemnts that the Grateful Dead members played in their 30 years of existence.

                                Pictured here is the guitar that Tom Hamiltonn of Joe Russo's Almost Dead (JRAD) plays. 
                                (Look them up if your into the dead.) This is the body shape that I'm aiming for. 
                                The left side and right sides are modeled after Tiger and a Stratocaster respectively.
                            </p>
